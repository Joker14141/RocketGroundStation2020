# Add labels

Make a folder called `data` and a file called `labels.txt` in data. This should be a comma separated file of all the labels in the dataset. The number of labels should be the same as the `DATA_LENGTH` variable.

For convenience, you can rename the `data-example` folder to `data` to get the labels.

# Usage

`git clone`

Load this folder in your preferred Java IDE (ex. Eclipse).

Run `Main.java`

# Window Management

Drag charts by dragging them around. Resize charts by dragging at the corners. Snap panels by double clicking on them. They will snap to the largest possible window from the position you clicked. Use the middle mouse button to delete charts.

# How to use

Select a chart, then select any data row to show in the chart. To change the x-axis, use right click.
