# RocketBaseStation

Work in progress UI for data coming from the rocket.

# Add labels

Make a folder called `data` and a file called `labels.txt` in data. This should be a comma separated file of all the labels in the dataset. The number of labels should be the same as the `DATA_LENGTH` variable.

For convinience, you can rename the `data-example` folder to `data` to get the labels.

# Usage

`git clone`

Load this folder in your preferred Java IDE (ex. Eclipse).

Run `Main.java`
